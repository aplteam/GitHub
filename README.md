# GitHub

## Overview

`GitHub` offers user commands that use the `GitHubAPIv3` package to communicate with GitHub.

`GitHub` does not have an API: in the event that you want to execute a command under program control check `GitHubAPIv3`'s API: for all user commands there are functions available in the `GitHubAPIv3` package.
